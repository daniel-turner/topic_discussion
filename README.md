#Dev League Topics: An Ongoing and Periodic Discussion

##Javascript
###Dynamic Typing
I thought this would bother me a lot coming from strongly-typed languages. So far, however, it's been uncomfortable at times, but mostly enjoyable!

When you name a bit of data, you give it a name, making it a variable. Every variable has a type which tells whether it is a number (and sometimes what kind of number it is), a string of text, or more complex but still elemental types like arrays and objects. This tells the program how to handle the data that the variable references. In strictly-typed languages, a variable's type is always strictly defined. You can change the type if you want, but every variable has an explicitly defined type which is enforced at all times. In a dynamically-typed language like javascript, on the other hand, the type of the variable is often inferred from the data it references, or contextually, in how it is used in functions.

###Functions and Closures
Between these topics and scope, I feel like I have a workable, journeyman understanding, but the wizardry that I know that's possible with some of this is still well beyond me.
###Scope
See above.
###Development Environment
I've gotten a lot more comfortable with the
